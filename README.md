## Current Status

- Rich feature list and mobile scaffolding are documented.
- Need to verify actual runtime behavior and data persistence.
- Operational estimate: **60%** (feature-heavy scaffolding, unverified runtime).

## Fixme Rationale

- Marked `_fixme` likely because the implementation needs verification, polish, and stabilization before use.

## API Endpoints

- None. Mobile app appears local/offline-first with optional AI calls.

## Tests

- Not detected or not run in this audit.

## Future Work

- Validate features end-to-end on device.
- Add automated tests for core flows.
- Harden data model and sync strategy.
